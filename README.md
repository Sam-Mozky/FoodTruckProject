# How to Run
The program will welcome you and prompt you to answer three questions. Answer the questions and if you wish to exit simply enter a null answer for any question. This will prompt the program to display a main menu, giving you 4 options. At your discretion, choose any of the 4 options, the last being to quit the program.

# Lessons Learned
Something that I learned from this project is how important it is to look back on previous lessons and topics. I often found myself sifting through the notes provided on Github in order to clarify something.

Another thing is the importance of clarifying questions. I am sometimes an overly independent person and struggle with asking for help. I learned a hard lesson with this assignment related to asking for help from the teachers as well as my peers. 

I am also known for procrastinating, and this project gave me another hard lesson of the importance of getting things done sooner rather than later. That way if questions do arise it's not too late to ask a question that could potentially affect the pass or fail of a project.
